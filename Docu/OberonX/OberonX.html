<H2>Objectives</H2>

<P>The OberonX programming language is an experimantal further development
of Oberon towards the Oberon-XSC pioneered in Karlsruhe. OberonX holds
new constructs, which improve the Oberon abstraction capabilities. The
programming of methematical software should be made easier by the introduction
of new language extensions. A new array concept is implemented, which introduces
a new semantic and syntactic definition, allowing lower bounds, semi-dynamic
and truly dynamic arrays in the language. Overloaded operators, in combiantion
with complex return values, increase the flexibility of the language by
removing the former restrictions. <BR>
</P>

<H2>Results</H2>

<H3>Arrays</H3>

<P>The most relevant features regard the possibility of indexing intervals
specified by lower bounds and lengths, of allowing open dynamic components
inside static ones, of using expressions to define the interval. The concept
of pointers bounded to arrays is no longer valid : the compiler itself
decides if an array block is to be considered static, semi-dynamic, dynamic
or open: this allows the definition of truly dynamic arrays. The possibility
of asymmetric multidimensional matrices declaration is also provided. Array
structures are treated as whole entities with consequence on assignments,
parameter passing and returs values. Te new array semantic results to be
different from the original one and requires a different point of wiev
for the programmer. </P>

<H3>Complex Return Values</H3>

<P>The return capability of Oberon functions has been extended to all the
type structures: no restrictions are imposed. This will increase the flexibility
and abstraction of the language when treating complex data types. Nested
function calls with complex return types are also allowed. </P>

<H3>Operators</H3>

<P>The use of a set of terminal symbols belonging to the operator class,
allows the declaration of functions usable as infix operators in expression
context. Overloading of compiler bounded and user defined operators is
therefore allowed. A method to resolve operator identification based on
the argument type signatures has been developed. Imported operator qualification
is not obligatory, but it can be necessary to avoid operator clashes, whose
presence does not allow the program to be compiled. In case of the absence
of a well suited operator, a method based on operan type distance computation
allows the identification of the best operator available, allowing the
use of every Oberon type construct. In case of approximated operator matching,
type conversion for the basic data types is automatically executed.</P>
